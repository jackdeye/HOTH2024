          Monoculture lawns contribute to biodiversity loss and soil degradation. They limit the habitat for beneficial insects and wildlife and require excessive water and maintenance.  Growing native plants reduces water usage and supports local ecosystems. Thousands of homes across California feature the same grass lawn, contributing to pesticide runoff and using millions of gallons of water a year, accounting for more than 50% of household water usage. 50 Shades of Green offers custom plant recommendations to diversify home gardens and fight against the dangers of monoculture.

          There are numerous benefits to both the surrounding ecology and the community. In a diverse landscape, different plant diseases and pest numbers don’t tend to build up, leading to a more stable ecosystem. Also, native plants require less care than non-native species and have adapted to local soils and conditions, resulting in a decrease in soil erosion.

          Looking towards the future, we plan to expand 50 Shades of Green to function outside of California, considering the new biodiversity those regions hold. We also plan to implement a price sorter to help those with financial struggles find cheap alternatives to more popular greenery. The site promotes expanded biodiversity and better air quality by encouraging people to change the plants around them.  As the dangers of global warming heighten, we must create new ways to protect the environment and our health.
